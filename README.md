The excelerate package accelerates the creation of supplementary tables for research papers.

- **Data Frame Conversion**: Easily insert supplementary results as ordered, numbered sheets in Excel spreadsheets.
- **Metadata Integration**: Include comprehensive metadata with legends and column descriptions in a README sheet.
- **Numbered Supplementary Files**: Automatically organises and numbers sheets and supplementary files for easy reference.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Accelerates the preparation of standardised, publication-ready tables.

This makes excelerate an invaluable tool for researchers looking to efficiently prepare tables that meet journal specifications.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ameliaes/excelerate")
library(excelerate)
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Data Files: Ensure your data files are in CSV or TSV format, with accompanying .cols files for metadata. Using the function `create_meta()`.

For example, `mtcars` (a built-in dataset in R) could be saved to `mtcars.csv`
and a corresponding `mtcars.csv.cols` file could look like this:

| Column_Name | Description                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| mpg         | Miles/(US) gallon           |
| cyl         | Number of cylinders         |
| disp        | Displacement (cu.in.)       |
| hp          | Gross horsepower            |
| drat        | Rear axle ratio             |
| wt          | Weight (1000 lbs)           |
| qsec        | 1/4 mile time               |
| vs          | Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight) |
| am          | Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) |
| gear        | Number of forward gears     |
| carb        | Number of carburetors       |

This can be generated by using `create_meta()`:

``` r
# Create metadata for mtcars dataset
create_meta(results = mtcars,
            colname_descriptions =
            c(
            "mpg" = "Miles/(US) gallon",
            "cyl" = "Number of cylinders",
            "disp" = "Displacement (cu.in.)",
            "hp" = "Gross horsepower",
            "drat" = "Rear axle ratio",
            "wt" = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
            "qsec" = "1/4 mile time",
            "vs" = "Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)",
            "am" = "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",
            "gear" = "Number of forward gears",
            "carb" = "Number of carburetors"
             ))
```


### 2. Generate Excel Files: Use the `sheet()`, `spreadsheet()` and `excelerate()` functions to create and save the tables.

``` r
# Create spreadsheet specifying tables for each sheet
supplementary_table <- spreadsheet(
  title = "Supplementary Table Example",
  filename = "path/to/save/example_table.xlsx",
  sheet("path/to/data", "results_file_1", "Sheet name 1", "Sheet legend 1"),
  sheet("path/to/data", "results_file_2", "Sheet name 2", "Sheet legend 2"),
  sheet("path/to/data", "results_file_3", "Sheet name 3", "Sheet legend 3"),
)

# Export to Excel
excelerate(supplementary_table)
```

Please see the [`Get Started`](https://ameliaes.github.io/excelerate/articles/excelerate.html) page for more detailed instructions.

### Output

The output is an excel file with multiple sheets. 

- The first sheet is called "README" by default.
  The README sheet cells contain the following in order:
  - The `title` specified in `spreadsheet()`.
  - The `sheet_legend`s, specified in `sheet()`, for each sheet.
  - The meta data supplied in the `.cols` files for each sheet.
- The remaining sheets are those supplied to `sheet()`. In the order each sheet object was supplied to `spreadsheet()`. Each sheet contains the data from the corresponding csv or tsv file, with the first row containing the column names.
